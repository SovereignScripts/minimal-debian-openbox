# Sovereign Debian Minimal Desktop

**A minimalist Debian build script using OpenBox for speed, clarity, and sovereignty.**

This project provides install scripts for setting up a lightweight Debian-based desktop system using OpenBox and only essential software. It's designed for users who want full control of their environment with minimal bloat â€” ideal for privacy-conscious users, Bitcoiners, creative professionals, and anyone who prefers a fast, no-fluff desktop.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- `xorg` + `openbox` for a lightweight GUI
- Simple, clean environment with:
  - Terminal (`lxterminal`)
  - File manager (`pcmanfm`)
  - Wallpaper viewer (`feh`)
  - Audio/video support (`mpv`, `alsa`)
  - Office suite (`libreoffice`, optional)
- Scripted, modular install
- Optional profiles for:
  - ðŸª™ Sovereign banking tools (Bisq, Electrum, Tor, Monero)
  - ðŸ“Š Data analysis (R, Python)
  - ðŸŽ¬ Creative/media tools (video editing, image design)

## ðŸš€ Goals
